This package contains traits with methods that are used for Phalcon v6 onward.

It can also be useful to others that want short snippets of code that perform
a task, without having to reinvent the wheel.

Some of these methods are just wrappers to PHP functions, thus allowing developers
to mock the method in order to get different results and cover paths of the
application with relevant tests.
