# Contributing to Phalcon Traits

Phalcon Traits is an open source project and a volunteer effort. We welcome 
contributions from all developers that wish to contribute. Please take a moment 
to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and 
effective for everyone involved.

## Contributions

Every contribution to Phalcon Traits must be as a result of an issue that is 
open in our repository. The contributions need to come in the form of a Pull 
Request and must always target the `develop` branch.

Each contribution must have some tests attached to it. We have 100% code 
coverage in this repository and want to keep it that way.

After a pull request is present, the maintainers of this project will review it,
and either merge it, provide feedback with potential changes or reject it. 

## Issues / Ideas / Suggestions

We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests. If you have 
found a bug or even have an idea/suggestion that could benefit this project, 
please open an issue, offering as much information as possible.

If the issue is a bug, and you can provide a fix for it, please do so. If the 
issue is a New Feature Request or an idea, please discuss it first with the team 
before sitting down and start coding. 

We want this repository to be small and act as a _helper_ to bigger projects.
